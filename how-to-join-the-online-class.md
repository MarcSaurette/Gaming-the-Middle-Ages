# How to join class

Our classes are scheduled take place on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11h30until 13h00. As of June, our class will be located in room 215 of Paterson Hall. Carleton has a tendency to change these without warning...

We will also be using a number of online resources to help with communication, file sharing and explaining learning activities.&#x20;

1. Figure out your Carleton email, either by activating it for the first time or ensuring that you are able to use it. See [here for instructions](https://carleton.ca/its/all-services/email/carleton-student-email/).&#x20;
2. [Install Teams](course-info/digital-tools/teams.md) on your computer and set it up. If at all possible don't use the browser version.
3. Make sure you are part of the "Gaming the Middle Ages" Team.&#x20;
4. If it doesn't pop up as an option in your Teams dashboard, click on the "Join or Create a Team" button and enter the code: **DDDDD .** This will only work if you are correctly logged in with your Carleton account.&#x20;
5. Find the general channel and text "hello" to tell us you're successfully logged in.&#x20;
