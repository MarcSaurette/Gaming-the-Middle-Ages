# How to join class

Our classes are scheduled take place on Wednesdays and Fridays from 10h00 until 11h30. As of August, our class will be located in [room 431 ](https://carleton.ca/tls/rooms/tory-building-431/)in Tory Building.

We will also be using a number of online resources to help with communication, file sharing and explaining learning activities.&#x20;

2. Sign up for a Carleton licence for [Microsoft Office](course-info/digital-tools/office.md) (even if you already have it installed)
3. [Install Teams](course-info/digital-tools/teams.md) on your computer and set it up. Click on the link for instructions.

If you are feeling particularly ambitious, before the first class you can sign up for a Perusall account and [provide me with your username](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o4OynJBMgJcuCVMLgcVruZjEQEMUv7NFOFz-K9f3jYA/edit?usp=sharing) for that and for google apps.&#x20;
