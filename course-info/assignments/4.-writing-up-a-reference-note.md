# 5. Writing up a Game note\*

{% hint style="info" %}
Due 10am, Tuesday October 10th.
{% endhint %}

### Goals

This week, you are asked to write up reference notes for two games:

1. a reference note for a historical game, game piece/ object
2. a reference note for a published modern/ contemporary game

{% hint style="info" %}
Since references are made to sources/objects that could theoretically be consulted by other people, childhood games (tag, hide-and-go-seek) cannot be referenced bibliographically so, I want you to limit this work to reference-able games.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Game Reference Note

Your goal is to create a game reference note. As this is a new field, there is not a clear standard, but we will try to establish a template.&#x20;

1. Create a new game reference note from the [google docs template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDjz2wlR5QV2AmAvedlP5DH2CZg805V0Zk9OXomrQfg/edit?usp=sharing).&#x20;
2. Make a copy and&#x20;

3\. Your goal is now to add a reference to a game. Any game works (I would of course prefer if it was a game that could be considered "medieval-ish", i.e. a game that seems to take place in the Middle Ages), but it should be something you have at hand (or could borrow from a . Something released in the last 40 years maybe, so that the publication information is more clear. I've posted [a sample note on Teams](https://cmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/sites/MEMS2001977/Shared%20Documents/General/fysm1405A-obsidian-shared/References/CaracassonneBigBox-2006.md?csf=1\&web=1\&e=LfoMdI) in the shared Obsidian vault, in the "Reference" folder. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Best not to try to cite a game from the Middle Ages â€“this is harder to cite, and we'll come back to how to do that in a[ future week](../../fundamentals/4.-what-are-games/case-study-chess.md)). If you need a game to cite, I have several in my office that you can borrow/ look at to get the key information. Or various other medievalish games are posted on Teams ([folder here](https://cmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/MEMS2001977/Shared%20Documents/General/Games%20Resources?csf=1\&web=1\&e=LGZiCZ)).
{% endhint %}

4\. Following along with the sample note, add the bibliographic information for your game. Essentially, the game does not matter, it is the process of putting information into a consultable format that is the goal here.&#x20;

5\. In the Game-Reference-Template I have offered two models - one for citing a boardgame and the other for a videogame. The first is easier usually, because there is less information to capture (videogames usually have much larger design teams etc) and the information to capture has more variability (you need to specify the platform, version, if you have any DLC added etc.)

6\. Write up a note outlining the **game information, provide a short summary of what the game is, add tags, links** to marketing/distribution sites online, rulebooks, etc. If you are referencing a boardgame, often[ Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com) (an online database of games and reviews) is a useful link. It can also be useful, especially at this point, to see how boardgames are tagged by designers/ superfans to get a sense of how games are perceived/categorized. For videogames, Yannick Rochat (whom we will read in a [future week](../../historical-games-studies/digital-games-survey-of-medieval-videogames.md)) suggests using the [MobyGames database](https://www.mobygames.com/search/quick?q=medieval) for searching for videogame trends.&#x20;

When you are done, upload the note to your student work folder.&#x20;
