# 4. Writing up a Reference note\*

### Goals

This week, you are asked to write up two different kinds of reference notes:

1. a reference note for a traditional academic article
2. a "reference" note for a game

### Requirements:

You will need to have Obsidian set up.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Since references are made to sources/objects that could theoretically be consulted by other people, childhood games (tag, hide-and-go-seek) cannot be referenced bibliographically so, I want you to limit your&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Bibliographic Reference Note

1. Create a new note in Obsidian. This will be a note referencing [the reading for this week](../../historical-games-studies/medieval-games.md#read-watch-listen): i.e.   the first chapter of Apostolos Spanos's _Games of History: Games and Gaming as Historical Sources_.
2. Title the note: "Spanos - 2021".&#x20;
3. Insert a template, but clicking on the "template icon" on the lefthand sidebar of Obsidian. Then Insert "ref-note-template". It will look like this now:

<div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-30 at 11.37.39 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Note with template added</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-30 at 11.37.29 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Select Ref-note-template</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-09-30 at 11.37.15 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Insert a template</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

4\. Your goal for making reference notes is that you will build up a library (a veritable database) of readings pertinent for the topic. This means that if you write up a reference here once, it will be ready to be reused any future time you might need it.&#x20;

5\.  I want you to cite Spanos' book chapter three ways according to Chicago style of references:

> The[ Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools\_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html) (which is mostly used by historians) uses the following template for citation of books and book chapters:
>
> _****_
>
> _**Chapter or other part of an edited book**_
>
> In a note, cite specific pages. In the bibliography, include the page range for the chapter or part.
>
> **Note**
>
> 1. Henry David Thoreau, “Walking,” in _The Making of the American Essay_, ed. John D’Agata (Minneapolis: Graywolf Press, 2016), 177–78.
>
> **Shortened note**
>
> 1. Thoreau, “Walking,” 182.
>
> **Bibliography entry**
>
> Thoreau, Henry David. “Walking.” In _The Making of the American Essay_, edited by John D’Agata, 167–95. Minneapolis: Graywolf Press, 2016.

6\. Using this format, cite Spanos' book as a note, shortened note and bibliography entry. I have placed a [sample version](https://cmailcarletonca.sharepoint.com/:t:/r/sites/MEMS2001977/Shared%20Documents/General/fysm1405A-obsidian-shared/References/Spanos%20-%202021.md?csf=1\&web=1\&e=EanceF) of the note in the "reference" folder of the shared class Obsidian folder on teams. Download this note from Teams and add it to your Obsidian vault before editing it. I want you:

* cite the book chapter in three different formats
* the link to the electronic version of the text (which is slightly different than the printed book itself)
* tags
* links to other notes that you might think are linked

7\. You're done part I. Add this note to your Student Work folder on Teams.

### Game Reference Note

The second note is to create a game reference note. As this is a new field, there is not a clear standard, but we will try to establish a template.&#x20;

1. Create a new note in Obsidian.&#x20;
