# 4. Writing up a Reference note\*

### Goals

This week, you are asked to write up two different kinds of reference notes:

1. a reference note for a traditional academic article
2. a "reference" note for a game

### Requirements:

You will need to have Obsidian set up.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Since references are made to sources/objects that could theoretically be consulted by other people, childhood games (tag, hide-and-go-seek) cannot be referenced bibliographically so, I want you to limit your&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Stages

1. Create a new note in Obsidian. This will be a note referencing the reading for this week: i.e.   the first chapter of Apostolos Spanos's _Games of History: Games and Gaming as Historical Sources_.
2. Title the note: Spanos -&#x20;
