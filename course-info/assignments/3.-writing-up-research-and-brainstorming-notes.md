# 3. Writing up research and brainstorming notes

This week, I want students to complete two notes:&#x20;

1. A permanent note answering the question, "What is a game?" based on the two assigned Nguyen readings.
2. The second is a brainstorming note.&#x20;

### 1. Research notes

The two readings by C.T. Nguyen provide students with the basic building blocks for answering the question, "What is a game?".&#x20;

A. Read through the two articles, highlighting and annotating with hypothes.is so that you will be able to reconstruct their key arguments and idea.

* with your annotations make sure you have made clear _your_ thoughts about Nguyen's ideas/words and provide some mental context so that you can make sense of the text that gets downloaded into Obsidian
* when you are reading are reading Nguyen's texts, identify terminology that seems key, but is new to you. To make these easy to find by you later, tag new terminology with a tag like "#NewTerminology" or "NeedToDefine". While hypothes.is is happy to use tags that are multiple words, Obsidian is not and won't recognize them (i.e. will use on the first word as a tag)

B. Import your hypothesis annotations into two new notes.   copy key sections/ quotations from the articles

I recommend the online [Encyclopedia of Ludic Terms](https://eolt.org/) (English "ludic"   is an adjective derived from the Latin, _ludus â€“_ game, play, sport, pastime). It is a useful and developing resource for studying games.&#x20;

### 2. Brainstorming note
