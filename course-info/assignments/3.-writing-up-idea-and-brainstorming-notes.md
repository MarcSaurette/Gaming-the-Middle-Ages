# 3. Writing up idea and brainstorming notes

This week, I want students to complete two notes:&#x20;

1. An idea or concept note answering the question, "What is a game?" based on the two assigned Nguyen readings and perhaps some additional research.
2. The second is a brainstorming note.&#x20;

### 1. Idea notes

The two readings by C.T. Nguyen provide students with the basic building blocks for answering the question, "What is a game?".&#x20;

**A. Read** through the two articles, highlighting and annotating with hypothes.is so that you will be able to reconstruct their key arguments and idea.

* with your annotations make sure you have made clear _**your**_** thoughts** about Nguyen's ideas/words and provide some mental context so that you can make sense of the text that gets downloaded into Obsidian
* when you are reading through Nguyen's texts, identify **terminology** that seems key, but is new to you. To make these easy to find by you later, tag new terminology with a tag like "#NewTerminology" or "NeedToDefine". While hypothes.is is happy to use tags that are multiple words, Obsidian is not and won't recognize them (i.e. will use on the first word as a tag)

**B. Import** your hypothesis annotations into two new notes.&#x20;

* Name the new notes "Annotations - Nguyen - 2016" for the article in _Philosophy Compass_ and the other "Annotations - Nguyen - 2020" for the chapter in _Games: Agency as Art_.&#x20;
* Anytime you import from Hypothes.is, you should name the files consistently, defining what kind of note it is (annotations), referring to the author (in this case, Nguyen) and date (2016/2020) of the publication.&#x20;

**C. Create** a new permanent note, with a title something like, "What is a Game" or "Game: a definition" or something that makes sense to you.&#x20;



**D. Populate** your note with information.&#x20;

1. Add tags at the end
2. Either by embedding notes from your annotations of Nguyen's texts, by copy-and-pasting them, provide key supporting material for your definition of what a game is. The key is, however, if you have a quotation, you need to explain it in your own words.&#x20;
3. In historical writing, we argue based on fundamental evidence - we either trust what scholars have written

I recommend the online [Encyclopedia of Ludic Terms](https://eolt.org/) (English "ludic"   is an adjective derived from the Latin, _ludus â€“_ game, play, sport, pastime). It is a useful and developing resource for studying games.&#x20;

### 2. Brainstorming note
