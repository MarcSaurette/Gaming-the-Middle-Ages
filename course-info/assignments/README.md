# Exercises\*

### Learning Together

Each week, we officially have 3hrs of assigned class time, divided into two time slots of 1 1/2 hrs each, on Mondays & Wednesdays. Generally, on Mondays, I will introduce the topic for that week, provide some background/ lecture and then typically we will discuss the readings and questions raised by the students in advance (via annotation). On Wednesdays, we may continue our discussion if there are a few unanswered questions and usually will work through a problem or exercise.&#x20;

I will provide some explanation and an initial introduction to the exercise on Wednesdays, but much of the work may need to be completed on the students own time after class. Usually feedback will be given via [Hypothes.is](../digital-tools/hypothes.is/) .

Examples of the kinds of exercises we will do in the Fall term:

* learn how to use note-making software ([Obsidian](../digital-tools/obsidian/)) and practice best scholarly knowledge production
* annotate a scholarly article together - using [hypothes.is](../digital-tools/hypothes.is/) to understand its structure and purpose (in order to teach how to read secondary sources)&#x20;
* practice different forms of Historical Game Analysis

In the [detailed outline for each week](broken-reference), I will post links to detailed instructions of the pertinent exercise.
