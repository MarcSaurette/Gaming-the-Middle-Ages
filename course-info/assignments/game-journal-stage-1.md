# 6. Game Journal - stage 1

### Starting Point:

The work of Clara Fernándex-Vara and Jeremiah McCall are two useful starting points for learning how:&#x20;

1. to conduct formal academic analysis of games&#x20;
2. to apply this analysis as a historian.

Fernández-Vara, Clara. _Introduction to Game Analysis_. New York: Routledge, 2015. (Link to [Library Catalogue](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL\_CRL/hgdufh/alma991002172329705153)). This text can only be consulted by one library user at a time, so I have posted a pdf on Teams for consultation as well.&#x20;

Jeremiah McCall has written extensivey on historical video games. A good starting point for the project are two articles/blog posts, laying out a framework for studying games in history:

* [http://gamestudies.org/2003/articles/mccall](http://gamestudies.org/2003/articles/mccall)
* [https://eolt.org/articles/history-games](https://eolt.org/articles/history-games)

### Requirements

* have Crusader Kings III installed
* have Obsidian working

### Instructions

#### 1. Install Crusader Kings III

{% hint style="info" %}
The goal of the game journal project is that everyone in class is going to play a medieval videogame and each of us is going to discuss our experiences of doing so, week by week in the second half of first term. Students with a strong desire to work an alternate game (and an explicit rationale† for why they want to) can focus on a different game, but must clear it with the professor first.&#x20;



It will be the responsibility of the student to adapt the assignment instructions to the game they choose.&#x20;



† This might be that you do not have a computer able to play the _CKIII._
{% endhint %}

1. Install Crusader Kings III on a computer. I am giving detailed instructions here, as if you have not used Steam before. I suspect many of you have and perhaps some already have played _CKIII._ If so, skip to section 2.&#x20;

* Install Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/about/](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)
* Open Steam, sign in (or register for a new account):​

3\. Once you've signed in and got Steam working and you've gotten past all the ads, you will need to add _Crusader Kings III_ to your library. Click on the "Add a Game" button on the bottom left corner of the window (at least in the Mac version).&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 2.54.34 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Then click on "Activate a Product on Steam". It will request that you sign a User Agreement. Offer your consent or they won't allow you to continue.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.02.11 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click </p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Then you will be brought to this screen. I will message those who need it, a code for the game _Crusader Kings III_ privately on Teams. Do not share these with anyone else.&#x20;

If you type the code in correctly and I've sent on the right code, Steam will add the game to your Libary on Steam. It will require that you then install the game. There should be an easy to find button to do so. Eventually, once the game is downloaded, the Steam window will look like this:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.09.16 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click on the play button and the analysis can begin!</p></figcaption></figure>

#### 2. Play Tutorial

1. Once you hit the play button, this will launch the Paradox launcher and will start the game. Click on new game. And then click on "Play Tutorial" in the top right corner.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Some of you have already played this game, but I still wish you to replay the tutorial level so that we can all be able to talk about the same material (at first at least, you can go off in your own direction later).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

<div>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.20.17 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click "New Game"</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.20.49 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The "Play Tutorial" button is on the top right corner</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-01 at 3.20.56 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click Play Tutorial again and get started. </p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

Depending how familiar you are with this kind of videogame, you might only play the tutorial (possibly more than once to understand different aspects of the game design), or you will play it once before launching into other scenarios.&#x20;

Your goal for this week is to try to play through the tutorial. This will likely take a few hours, or more if you are new to the genre/ interface. **Get playing!**

#### 3. Your first Journal Entry

So you've played some Crusader Kings III. Congratulations for getting through the tutorial, it is a pretty complicated game so it takes some thought. If you are confused, know that many in the class are too.&#x20;

As you play, you should document the game play. This can take the form of screenshots, recorded gameplay or written/typed notes.&#x20;
