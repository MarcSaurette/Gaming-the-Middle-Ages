# Optional Learning Activities

On every other Thursday starting in October, students are encouraged to join me (and other students) in the History Lounge for additional activities (sometimes with snacks!) that will complement our learning in class. My hope is to keep these events open to others outside our class, as well as others, so that you can meet other upper year students interested in History and Historical Game Studies.&#x20;

Activities may include:

* playing boardgames &#x20;
* watching/ playing videogames in person
* getting help with assignments
* hearing from other students and professors on how they are working on games
* fieldtrips?
