> The critical components of a game's historical problem space, again, are
>
> * A primary _player agent_ representing some form of historical actor tasked with one or more designer-made _goals_, ultimately expressed as victory conditions, operating within&#x20;
> * a _virtual gameworld_, a simulated world that usually refers to specific historical locations and contains the game components, essentially the game system, within an environment and geography that includes
> * _gameworld elements: agents_, _minions, resources, obstacles,_ and _tools_, whose function primarily is to enable and/or constrain the player agent in achieving those designed goals;
> * and so, the player forms _strategies_, makes _choices_ and adopts _behaviors_ to reach those designed goals, optimally by capitalizing on abilities and circumventing, overcoming, or working within the constraints in the gameworld.
> * A meta space of _genre conventions_ about gameplay that significantly shape the virtual space defined and contained within its components. Genre conventions are in turn shaped by all sorts of economic, social and cultural factors influencing design teams...

The goal of our analysis of Crusader Kings III is to discern and describe the answers to these solutions.&#x20;
