# Deadlines\*

{% hint style="danger" %}
Late assignments will be penalized at the rate of **5% per 24 hour period** that the assignment is late. Thus a late project due on Monday at 10am but handed in at Monday 11am or Tuesday 9 am will both be subject to the same late penalty deductions. Delays are cumulative, thus something 25 hours late = 2 x 24hr = 10% deduction.&#x20;

The professor may also choose to not accept some late assignments.
{% endhint %}

I realize you will be asked to make choices about how to allot your time this year. You need to choose between school work and life outside of university. You will also need to decide how much time you spend on each class. Late penalties are meant to keep a level-playing field between classes and between students, to motivate everyone to play by the rules. &#x20;

In this course students will sometimes be working together in small groups. When working together, it is paramount that every student pulls their weight and gets work done on time - or else the whole project could fall apart.&#x20;

**Please let me know (in advance)** if there are good reasons for why you can't get something in one time, and we can try to find possible solutions (see below, [Extensions](deadlines.md#extensions-and-accommodations)).

### Extensions and Accommodations

The current university policy for asking for special extensions due to illness is available from the Registrar's office, which has a COVID-19 self-declaration form ([https://carleton.ca/registrar/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19\_Self-declaration.pdf](https://carleton.ca/registrar/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19\_Self-declaration.pdf)). Students can use it to ask for deferral/extensions for term work.  Students can submit this form, instead of having to get a doctorâ€™s note.

As far as I am concerned, you do not need to give me (Marc Saurette) a doctor's note or a self-declaration form. You can just let me know if problems or illnesses have arisen and we can discuss timelines and strategies for you to complete your work. If you have been sick and this has delayed you from completing assignments, please let me know sooner rather than later so that we can work with you to come up with a new plan/ timeline. I understand that illness can mess up your intended work timeline, so the more information I know, the more I can help you plan.
