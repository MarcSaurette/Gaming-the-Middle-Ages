# Participation

The biggest worry past first year students have about speaking in class at the beginning of term is that "they don't know what to say". _Of course they don't!_ Speaking in class is part of a process; it requires that we try different ways of interacting and over time students learn how and why academics talk to each other in specific ways to allow for open, evidence based debate. The classroom is a laboratory for us to experiment with speach, it is not something that you are expected to have mastered before you arrive.&#x20;

Participation is very important for this class since one of its main learning objectives is to improve students’ ability to verbalize their thoughts and assesments, as well as logically discuss/ debate. Nothing can be evidence unless it is placed in a logical argument, and class is meant to let you practice this faculty.&#x20;

At minimum, students are expected to attend class having read and processed the readings, and be willing to talk about them (and by talk I mean out loud in the group). Students are expected to engage during the course to identify key themes and issues, evaluate the authors’ positions/ reasoning/ logic, ask and answer questions from classmates and the professor, etc.

* Normally, this takes place in person – during class lectures and small group discussions, and through one-on-one interaction with the professor (office hours, conversations before/after class).

### Be Prepared

The most important part of participation is being prepared. You might be willing to contribute and be able to speak persuasively, but it is very difficult to contribute properly if you have not read and thought about the materials assigned for each class. You are asked to make annotations on the readings and then turn these annotations into notes. This will be an important part of your participation.&#x20;

### How to Participate

Our plan is to give students a wide variety of opportunities to actively participate in the course. Students will be able to actively participate through the following :

* Annotation and commenting on hypothes.is.&#x20;
  * Students are asked to read, comment on and reflect on the readings (and additional assigned/optional texts) via hypothes.is.
  * these can provide questions for Q+A's
* Q+A periods during lectures&#x20;
  * Students will be encouraged to add questions/comments throughout lectures; during mid-lecture Q+A periods, the professor will seek out questions/comments to discuss further/respond to
* Small group breakout sessions during class&#x20;
  * during some classes, students will be broken up into small (5 person) breakout groups to discuss a particular question/theme, after which groups will be invited to report back to the full class.
* Additional voluntary discussion group meetings
  * The aim of these meetings is to give students another opportunity to connect and dive deeper into any of the intellectual content of the course.
  * for Winter term, you will need to work with your classmates outside of classtime to collaborate on different game design projects.&#x20;
* Discussions with prof during office hours

### General principles of evaluation:&#x20;

The weekly student evaluation will be filled out on this form:&#x20;

| Points | Nature of Participation                                                                                                                                                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | Student does not engage in participation (i.e. ask questions in class/ on Teams, respond during the in-person portion of class, and has not done the readings.         |
| 1      | Student participates but has not read the readings. OR the student does not participate but has read the readings (but not annotated them).                            |
| 2      | Student does not participate, but has read and annotated the readings.                                                                                                 |
| 3      | Student participates minimally and has done the readings with minimum number of annotations on hypothesis.                                                             |
| 4      | Student participates more than typical and shows considerable engagement with the readings on hypothesis.                                                              |
| 5      | Student participates exceptionally (asks questions and gives answers during class, posts on Teams and help peers, and shows exceptional engagement with the readings.  |

Given the variety of factors that might impact a given student’s ability to participate fully and consistently through any one of these methods (and to ensure that the professor can be as flexible as possible accommodating students’ specific situations), participation will be understood holistically. That is to say, participation is viewed as the sum total of a student’s participation through all of the above (and other) methods – meaning that it is possible for students to successfully satisfy their participation mark without engaging in all types of participation every week. While I will keep track of my assessments of your participation, you ultimately are responsible for assessing your participation.&#x20;

In general, here are some examples of the type of questions students will be asked to think about in evaluating their participation:

* Were they present during in-person parts of the course?
* Did the student remain strongly focused during the class and did s/he/they seek to actively listen/process/integrate the ideas during class lectures/discussions?
* Did the student participate in class discussion (e.g. through live questions/comments; through the chat/whiteboard functions)?&#x20;
* Did the student demonstrate significant and insightful knowledge regarding class material (has s/he/they been able to consistently answer questions about the readings in class, pose thoughtful questions in/outside of class, demonstrated that s/he/they has attempted to connect the themes/ideas of class to the contemporary world, etc)?
* Did the student enhance the learning environment by participating respectfully in discussions with her/his/their colleagues?

While you will be asked to self-evaluate your participation, your instructor will keep track of their subjective evaluation of your work.&#x20;

* First, in each class, the professor will track and record attendance and observable forms of participation– including live questions/comments; content engagement on Teams; discussions in breakout groups; etc.&#x20;
* Second, at the end of each week, you will be asked given a link to a MS Form and fill out a weekly work sheet, providing links to work completed and describing your work each week.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;If the professor assesses that a student has consistently (i.e. in every class) participated at an exceptional level throughout the term, the professors may decide to reward bonus marks, above what the student has self-assessed.
