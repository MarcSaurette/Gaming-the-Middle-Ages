# Game Speeches and Texts\*

After the Fall reading week, we will begin a pedagogical game focussed on the Fourth Crusade, which led to the capture of Constantinople. Students will be expected to write and present (as speeches) various texts in support of game play.&#x20;

### Speeches

The key game mechanic in _1204: The Fourth Crusade_ game is debate, discussion, persuasion and rhetorical manipulation. Each student has been assigned two times during the term when they are required to make a 5 minute formal presentation

Students have been [provisionally assigned speaking times and topics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dGJJVJNTRgS7qoLvDOmXIsl1hq0eW5ZBElUmlUsl8mw/edit?usp=sharing) according to their roles, but as a faction, may decide to alter the schedule. The number of formal speeches (2 per player) cannot reduced, but the timing can be changed by students for themselves.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Students can change their own timing, so long as they can get another student **in their faction** to switch with them. Each faction needs at least one formal presentation&#x20;
