# Game Texts\*

After the fall reading week, we will begin a pedagogical game focussed on the Fourth Crusade, which led to the capture of Constantinople.&#x20;

Students will be expected to write and present (as speeches) various texts (about 1,200 words in total) in support of game play. What each student will write will depend on the character they have been assigned and their specific goals. Usually these are preparations for speeches (a script) or texts intended to convince/ manipulate fellow game players.

More details to follow (character sheets will be distributed in late September/ early October).&#x20;
