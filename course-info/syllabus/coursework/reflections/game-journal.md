For much of the first term, students will work on understanding the videogame _Crusader Kings III_ with the tools provided by Fern√°ndez-Varro's _Introduction to Game Analysis_ and McCall's concept of the _Historical Problem Space_.&#x20;

Starting halfway through Fall term, we will begin to work on the major project of the term. Each week on [Obsidian](../../../digital-tools/obsidian/), students will be responsible for completing one more step of the overall project. And at the end of term, each student will write up their findings as a larger essay.&#x20;

Details about the project will be distributed before reading week.&#x20;
