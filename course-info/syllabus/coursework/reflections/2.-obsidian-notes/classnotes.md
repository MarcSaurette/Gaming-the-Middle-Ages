# Classnotes

For two weeks per term, students will be responsible for sharing a polished version of their classnotes to our class Teams, using the template in the course's started Obsidian vault.&#x20;

* You will upload a completed .md file to the Classnotes folder in the files to the General channel on teams. Everyone in class will be able to read and download the file to their own vaults.
* Your note should be titled Week No. Classnotes-YourName; for example, if I was submitting classnotes for week 3, I would entitle my file "Week 3 Classnotes - Saurette.md

### What is the point of sharing classnotes?

The goal of this assignment is two-fold:&#x20;

* to get students to practice converting ephemeral notes taken in class into a more permanent written piece (i.e. practice making smartnotes);
* to create an open repository of notes for the class that students can use to supplement their own notes;
* to share your notes with fellow students and see how they make notes. This way we can see the different ways in which people record their thoughts and see different paths your fellow students have taken with the same material. You can use or innovate on the models that previous students have used.
