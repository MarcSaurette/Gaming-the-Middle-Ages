# Classnotes

Classnotes try to record lectures and thoughts expressed in class by professors and students (both are important!). Class lectures are often _extemporized,_ which means that even thought there might be an underlying idea and they might based on extensive notes, in the classroom, student questions and interests have a way of changing the direction of the conversation. Classroom discussions therefore can sometimes be chaotic, and therefore classnotes should be imagined not just as a _record_ of class, but as a _thinking-though_ or a _making-sense_ of the class. Classnotes are therefore something more akin to a [permanent note](broken-reference) (which we discuss elsewhere).&#x20;

\---

Two weeks per term, each student will be responsible for sharing a polished version of their classnotes to our class Teams, using the template in the course's starter Obsidian vault. With our current enrollment, this means that each week we should have 2-3 students uploading classnotes.

* You will upload a completed .md file to the Classnotes folder in the files to the General channel on teams. Everyone in class will be able to read and download the file to their own vaults.
* Your note should be titled Week No. Classnotes-YourName; for example, if I was submitting classnotes for week 3, I would entitle my file "Week 3 Classnotes - Saurette.md".

### What is the point of sharing classnotes?

The goal of this assignment is two-fold:&#x20;

* to get students to practice converting ephemeral notes taken in class into a more permanent written piece (i.e. practice making smartnotes);
* to create an open repository of notes for the class that students can use to supplement their own notes;
* to share your notes with fellow students and see how they make notes. This way we can see the different ways in which people record their thoughts and see different paths your fellow students have taken with the same material. You can use or innovate on the models that previous students have used.

### Signing up

Students need to sign up for the weeks they wish to submit notes in advance. Add your name to two different weeks [in this spreadshee](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sCloWfNgj3t\_YD8-vx2toFdw4BbTuWXFHJr2mHYP5zc/edit?usp=sharing)t. Remember to add these weeks to your list of assignments due in whatever calendar you are using to keep track of deadlines.&#x20;
