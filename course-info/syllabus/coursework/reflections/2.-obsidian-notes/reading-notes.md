# Reading Notes

In the first few weeks of class, we will practice reading academic works and then take notes with them.&#x20;

Building on the smart note system, students will be asked to not simply&#x20;

### What is the point of writing up notes on your readings?

* You make _reference notes_, because I want students to practice writing up a proper citation for works we are reading. Proper citation is in part about 1) showing you can follow scholarly norms, in part becuase 2) sloppy citations make you look unprofessional and 3) (most importantly!) future-you will thank past-you if properly done references are a click away and you can easily track down an origin to your ideas. &#x20;
* You write _literature notes_ to show how you have thought about the reading. Literature-notes  (and importing thoughts from hypothes.is) allow you to have a record of passages you found most helpful/ interesting and record _why_ you thought so. This means that these passages (quotations w/annotations) are then available when you want to come back to that topic - in this class or in others (believe me, historians come back to ideas like, "What is history" over and over again...).
