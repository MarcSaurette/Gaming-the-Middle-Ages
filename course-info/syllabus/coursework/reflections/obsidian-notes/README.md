# 2. Obsidian Notes\*

All of you take notes - for school, for life, we need to record things so we can remember them and make sense of them. In this course, I am hoping to teach you a specific way of taking/making notes that will give you the tools for academic and intellectual success.&#x20;

If you want to know more about the how to take smart notes, I recommend you take a look at the work of SÃ¶nke Ahrens, who wrote a concise and readable guide, [_How to take smart notes_](https://takesmartnotes.com)_._ His website contains the kernel of his ideas, which I will also communicate to you through our assignments and exercises.&#x20;
