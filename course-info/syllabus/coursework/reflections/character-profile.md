# 1. Profile\*

{% hint style="info" %}
The professor's sample "character" profile [can be consulted here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTav0xNTGFqYl175jV3GUcnK36Jb9HE\_xdcQqRlq\_xc/edit?usp=sharing).

An individualized template for each student will be provided directly to them in the first week of class.
{% endhint %}

I want to start the year with a bit of a playful exercise. I want you to describe yourself (i.e. you the student a real person) as the character of a role-playing game (RPG). Imagine yourself as a new student at a _School for the Medievalist Arts_. Your goal will be to describe yourself using a character sheet – trying to creatively imagine your (real) self as a conglomeration of skills, principles, character traits and the such as you might in a game. I'll provide a template and you are free to play with it to make it work for you. You will identify what skills you want to  develop – training in domains of knowledges along with your classmates to solve historical mysteries.&#x20;

I will distribute a profile template (via google sheets) to everyone. It will consist of several pages - only some of which need to be filled out, some of which will be used in the future for the professor to give feedback.&#x20;

Also, I've created an overly-detailed guide on how to go about creating a Medievalist character (\*\*\*\***link here**\*\*\*\*). This started off as a lark but then I kept going... In a nod to the fantasy genre, the guide describes Medievalists as if engaging in a battle between good and evil (which perhaps we are...) and outlines potential skills to learn, knowledge domains to specialize in, intellectual weapons to wield etc. If you have an affinity for Role-Playing Games it will look familiar-ish to you.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The goal of your profile is to imagine yourself as if you were a character - how would a player quantify your skills and abilities, how would they describe your background and preparation for university, and what special knowledge, ideas, and creativity help define you. And also think about how you want to develop - if you want to level up, what skills would you seek to master next?
{% endhint %}

#### Contents

Your  profile should include:

* your name
* your backstory (is there something about your biography which drives you to study the past? or games?)
* describe your  appearance – what you look like, how you dress (feel free to be as imaginative/creative as you want. I modelled my description on the works of 19th century medievalist and horror author, M.R. James.&#x20;
* what chosen field of study and possible future directions would you want to study: architecture? or medieval manuscripts? Or court records?) What are your academic hopes and dreams?
* have a space to list skills to be developed in class in the future. This in essence will be a place where you think about skills you have "earned" over the course of the class.&#x20;
* have a place for academic reputation (you all start with 10 - the highest until you demonstrate yourself to be unworthy)
* any possessions and devices you might have on your person (this is useful so that I know what OS most people will be using...)

### Alternate projects

Maybe you have a hatred for RPGs, maybe you love to write short fiction and want to star yourself as a protagonist, maybe you paint, maybe you prefer a confession video profile?

If you don't want to do the faux-RPG profile, let me know and we can agree in advance on a creative and fun alternative that you can complete. The key goal of this assignment is to present yourself in a playful fashion - but less you classmates get a sense of who you are from them.&#x20;
