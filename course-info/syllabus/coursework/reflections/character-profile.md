# 1. Profile\*

{% hint style="info" %}
The professor's sample "character" profile [can be consulted here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTav0xNTGFqYl175jV3GUcnK36Jb9HE\_xdcQqRlq\_xc/edit?usp=sharing).

An individualized template for each student will be provided directly to them in the first week of class.
{% endhint %}

I want to start the year with a bit of a playful exercise. I want you to describe yourself (i.e. you the student a real person) as the character of a role-playing game (RPG). Imagine yourself as a new student at a _School for the Medievalist Arts_. Your goal will be to describe yourself using a character sheet – trying to creatively imagine your (real) self as a conglomeration of skills, principles, character traits and the such as you might in a game. I'll provide a template and you are free to play with it to make it work for you. You will identify what skills you want to  develop – training in domains of knowledges along with your classmates to solve historical mysteries.&#x20;

I will distribute a profile template (via google sheets) to everyone. It will consist of several pages - only some of which need to be filled out, some of which will be used in the future for the professor to give feedback.&#x20;

Also, I've created an overly-detailed guide on how to go about creating a Medievalist character (\*\*\*\***link here**\*\*\*\*). This started off as a lark but then I kept going... In a nod to the fantasy genre, the guide describes Medievalists as if engaging in a battle between good and evil (which perhaps we are...) and outlines potential skills to learn, knowledge domains to specialize in, intellectual weapons to wield etc. If you have an affinity for Role-Playing Games it will look familiar-ish to you.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The goal of your character is for you to create an identity (perhaps much like yourself, or perhaps not at all like you), which will allow you to imagine how someone might begin down the path of exploring the discipline of history/ medieval studies. What makes someone study the Middle Ages? What kind of experiences or background would help you to excel?&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Contents

Your  profile should include:

* your name
* your backstory (is there something about your background which drives you to study the past? or games?)
* describe your character's appearance – what they look like, how they dress (be as imaginative as you want. Are they human or not?
* their chosen field of study and possible future directions (i.e. would they want to study architecture? or medieval manuscripts? Or court records?) What are their academic hopes and dreams?
* have a space to list skills to be developed in class in the future. This in essence will be a place where you list skills you have "earned" over the course of the class.&#x20;
* have a space for "weapon proficiencies" (this will be where you list different academic tricks you have been able to use in your writing, arguments and discussions)
* have a place for academic reputation (you all start with 10 - the highest until you demonstrate yourself to be unworthy)
* any possessions you might have on your person (which could be used in the future)
* a space for a journal (i.e. a cuPortfolio journal). In future weeks you will be writing other things for class, and they will form a journal of sorts for the first term.&#x20;

### Questions to ask during your character creation:

Who is your acolyte? Give a name and a brief description of your acolyte’s physical appearance and personality. Is s/he/they tall? Handsome? Charming? Blonde? Brilliant? Kinda dumb?&#x20;

How is your character able to attend the prestigious Academy? Is s/he/they royalty? A charity case? The son of a rich crime lord? A child prodigy? It’s up to you to decide how your acolyte pays their tuition.&#x20;

Why were you chosen to be a member of the Academy? What legendary act of intelligence, bravery, chivalry, skill, heart or daring did you perform to be given the title of Acolyte of the Academy?&#x20;

What is your acolyte’s drive or ultimate goal? Does s/he/they desire ancient and obscure knowledge? Or want to find true love? Become the heir to their family’s empire? Be the first to adventure into the unknown? This will be the thing your acolyte strives for throughout the game.&#x20;

Lastly, draw/find a picture of your acolyte. This will help both you and your fellow students get a better idea of who your character is and why he was chosen to be a member of the Academy.&#x20;

**After character creation has happened:**

Based on what you see of your fellow acolytes: please answer the following for two other acolytes:

* What do you propose is their greatest strength?&#x20;
* &#x20;What might you suspect is their greatest weakness?
* Do you have an arch-rival or ardent appreciation of another student?&#x20;
  * Roll a six sided die (or visit the [google digital one](https://www.google.com/search?q=dice+roller))
    * §  1-2 = you have an archrival
    * §  3-4 = you find yourself admiring another
    * §  5-6 = you’re pretty neutral about the others
  * If you have an archrival or object of admiration, choose a character (based on what you’ve read) or roll a 1d20 ([google digital one](https://www.google.com/search?q=dice+roller)). Numbers are randomly preassigned to all members of the class.
  * let the professor know name/ the number so he can incorporate this into the storyline (and let you know what your number corresponds to).
