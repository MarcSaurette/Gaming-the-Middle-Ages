# Writing

In the first term, the students will be expected to write short pieces each week to practice the tools of game analysis, and to reflect on your learning. The key to academic success is practice â€“ especially practicing writing. Writing is hard for everyone, especially when the style, format and goals are unfamiliar. I'll try to make the expectations clear and over time the expected norms of writing will become familiar to you. Above all I just want you to get used to writing without worrying to much about being perfect at it. &#x20;

Some of the first written work you will work on:

1. &#x20;[Profile](overflow-written-work/character-profile.md)
2. Different kinds of [notes](2.-obsidian-notes/) to practice the _smartnote_ method.
3. A [game journal ](3.-game-journal.md)detailing your analysis of the game _Crusader Kings III_.&#x20;

In the Winter term, we will be working on a multi-stage [game design project](../game-design-project.md).&#x20;
