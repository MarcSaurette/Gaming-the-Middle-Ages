# Writing

{% hint style="danger" %}
If expectations for writing are ever unclear, talk to your professor. I want to make sure you understand what is expected of you and am **very** **happy** to guide you through the process. My job is to help you!
{% endhint %}

In the first term, the students will be expected to write short pieces each week to practice the tools of academic writing, game analysis, and to reflect on your learning. The key to academic success is practice â€“ especially practicing writing. Writing is hard for everyone, especially when the style, format and goals are unfamiliar. I'll try to make the expectations clear and over time the expected norms of writing will become familiar to you. Above all I just want you to get used to writing without worrying to much about being perfect at it. &#x20;

In the first term, some of the first written work you will work on:

1. Different kinds of [notes](notes.md) to practice the _smart note_ method.
2.

In the Winter term, we will be working on a multi-stage [game design project](game-design-project.md).&#x20;
