# Coursework\*

When learning in person, professors and students meet in class for lectures and to discuss readings, debate etc. Thus, some learning happens together at the same time, and some other learning happens on the student's own time (e.g. writing papers, doing readings etc.).&#x20;

I divide work into oral and written work. Oral work usually consists of spoken presentations and "participation" i.e. being in class, asking questions, showing you've learned from doing the readings, etc (an abbreviation of _et cetera_, Latin for "and other things"). But participation can also be based on "conversations"/ discussions on the [Teams](../../digital-tools/teams.md) platform outside of class time – it might be oral or it might be written. This makes it hard to quantify participation, so you will at different times during the year be responsible for describing and evaluating your own participation.

All written work must be completed for a student to pass the course.&#x20;

{% tab title="Participation" %}
So, let's get this out in the open. Participation is always difficult to assess. Even in face-to-face classes, I can measure what I see, but I don't know the work that has been done behind the scenes (especially if you are a quiet or shy student). So typically, I have had students assign themselves a mark for participation each class – based on a rubric assigning points for attendence and for degree of participation.&#x20;

I will take attendence and at the end of each class, will request that you assign yourself a mark of 5 for the quality of your participation. At the end of each term, you will write up a process letter explaining the quality of your participation, part of which will be to assess your contributions to class discussion.

{% tab title="Profile" %}
The first thing to do in this class is put together a profile to introduce yourself to your fellow students and the professor. This can take different formats - a written blurb, a short video, a simple website.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Notes" %}
The key to academic success is practice – especially practicing writing. Writing is hard for everyone, especially when a genre is unfamiliar or the expectations are unclear. I'll try to make the expectations clear and over time the expected norms of writing will become familiar to you. Above all I just want you to get used to writing without worrying to much about being perfect at it.&#x20;

We are using the tool [Obsidian](../../digital-tools/obsidian.md) to help you practice different kinds of writing - citing works properly, turning the texts of experts into your own words, and then processing these ideas.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Exercises" %}
Each week (usually during the Wednesday class), we will complete short exercises to introduce you to different tools in the Historical Games Studies/ Medievalist toolkit. This might be me demonstating how to use cuPortfolio or Hypothes.is or getting you to complete a multi-stage library search on your own.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Feedback" %}
&#x20;You will be asked to provide comments and constructive criticism to written work completed by your peers ([expectations set out here](peer-feedback.md)). We'll use the annotation tool [hypothes.is](../../digital-tools/hypothes.is/) to make comments on each other's work.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Process Letter" %}
A "[proces letter](process-letters.md)" is a term we use to describe an end-of-term self-evaluation of your own work. You will write this up as a way to justify the grade you will assign to yourself for first term, based on guided questions I will provide. Some of your work will be done in groups, so part of your letter will be the pleasant job of acknowledging those who did an exceptional job and the more difficult one of calling out those who were less  satisfactory.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

In the second term, the class will work on a [group project ](game-design-project.md)that we will work on each week in order to develop a new historically- inspired game.&#x20;

### **Each week you will:**&#x20;

* prepare for class by completing the assigned readings and making annotations on the texts (primary sources, secondary sources, images, websites) with [Hypothes.is](../../digital-tools/hypothes.is/).
* attend seminars, where I will either lecture, or lead a discussion  and answer questions, or run an exercise
* complete weekly exercises intended to practice foundational skills of History/ Medieval Studies/Historical Game Studies
* write notes for the class and your gameplay with [Obsidian](../../digital-tools/obsidian.md)
* play games and think about them
