# 1. Introduction to Hypothes.is

### Requirements

In order for you to complete this exercise, you will need to have

* successfully logged into the class [Teams](../../../digital-tools/teams.md)
* downloaded and installed [Obsidian](../../../digital-tools/obsidian/)
* signed up for a [Hypothes.is](../../../digital-tools/hypothes.is/) account

### Steps

1 - Download the class "starter vault", called "fysm1405A-obsidian-course-handbook" from Teams. You can find the folder in the files of the general channel. To find this, make sure you have clicked on the "General" channel in left sidebar, and then click on "Files" in the topbar to the right.&#x20;

2 - Right-click or click the elipsis (...) to select "download". In some versions of Teams you can drag and drop the folder onto your device.&#x20;

3 - This folder will likely download to your device as a compressed .zip file. Most computers will automatic unpack the zip file. If not, do so as your particular device permits. Place the folder somewhere on your computer you will easily find it (I have a folder named "Obsidian Vaults" to make it easy).&#x20;

4 - Open up Obsidian. You will be presented with the screen that looks like the following. Choose the option, "Open Folder as Vault".

It will ask you whether you trust the author of this vault. Press, "Trust author and enable plugins".&#x20;

The vault will open up with the settings panel open. If you want, you can click on "Check for updates" to update any plugins are installed by default in our vault. There are lots of ways for you to customize your Obsidian, but I think you should save doing that for later â€“ once you've had some time with the software first. Close the settings panel.&#x20;

Obsidian should show something like this window. On the left side of the window should be a list of files in the vault and on the right side there will be either no note or maybe this one. Reading through the instructions of note "01-Getting Started". The page icon lets you create a new note. The vault icon on the bottom left (it looks like an old fashioned safe) lets you open or create vaults. The cog icon lets you play with the settings.&#x20;

Watch the linked youtube video, a short strangely-hypnotic video that shows the basics of Obsidian: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88). This is the first in a series of videos outlining the fundamentals of Obsidian.&#x20;

Read through the note to get a sense of different ways to use Obsidian (including using tags and links - its key tool).&#x20;
