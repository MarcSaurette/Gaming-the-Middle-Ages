# Exercises\*

### Learning Together

Each week, we officially have 3hrs of assigned class time, divided into two time slots of 1 1/2 hrs each, on Wednesdays & Fridays. Generally, some days I will introduce new topics, provide some background/ lecture and then typically we will discuss the readings and questions raised by the students in advance (via annotation). On other days, we may continue our discussion if there are a few unanswered questions and usually will work through a problem or exercise.&#x20;

Examples of the kinds of exercises we will do in the Fall term:

* learn how to use smart notes and practice best scholarly knowledge production
* annotate a scholarly article together - using [Perusall](../../../digital-tools/perusall.md) to understand its structure and purpose (in order to teach how to read secondary sources)&#x20;

In the detailed outlines for each week, I will post links to detailed instructions of the pertinent exercise.
