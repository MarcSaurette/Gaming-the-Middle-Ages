# Assessment

{% hint style="info" %}
At the end of first term, students will submit their Game Journal and their entire Obsidian vault to show the work they have done over first term. This work will form the final basis on which the professor will offer feedback and suggest a "recommended mark".&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Most first-year classes in History are full year (two semester) courses. We do this so that students who arrive at university have time to settle into class and get accustomed to the expectations of university. The First-Year Seminar program is designed specifically to address this, focusing not only on disciplinary content (i.e. teaching you facts about the past) but also teaching skills fundamental for academic success.&#x20;

This is why this class is designed to start off slow, getting you to question what you already know about the Middle Ages and teaching you the building blocks of historical analysis/writing. I hope that you are able to experience the class as collaborative, not competitive. You are all starting off together and I want you to see each other as peers, colleagues and potential friends from whom you all can learn. Assignments are thus designed with the expectation that you can work together with others or that you see/read other students' work and learn from it. Your peers can be inspiring.&#x20;

_Gaming the Middle Ages_ is designed for gradual entry, with the first term designed to have no formal grades assigned for work, but rather there is a mixture of required and optional work that you can use to earn points. You have many different ways of gaining experience points (XP), and once you reach different levels, you are worthy to win new titles and honours (see table below). If you want, you can tell yourself that these correspond to different grade levels. At the end of the term, you also will be responsible for writing up an [evidence-supported self-assessment](../coursework/process-letters.md) of your participation and work (see [Process Letter](../coursework/process-letters.md)), taking your point level , your academic [reputation](../deadlines.md#academic-reputation) and other qualitative features into account. I am using this system in order to avoid a system of grading that has the potential to make you all less collaborative and more competitive. For more on why I am not using traditional grading, see the next page, "[Why are there no grades](why-no-grades.md)".

In the second term, together as a class we will decide whether to retain a non-grade system, or whether you corporately wish to return to a more familiar system.&#x20;

### Titles and Honorifics to be Earned

From 0-200  200-500 XP, you are considered a normal run of the mill Acolyte.&#x20;

| 200                | Acolyte                                                                |
| 0                  | Novice \[name here]                                                    |

### How to Earn XP

All students start out the class with 0 XP. As you complete classwork, assignments, students will rise up and begin to differentiate themselves from one another. Each student is reponsible for updating their experience sheet when work has been completed to keep a running tally.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The professor also may assign bonus XP at his discretion in recognition of a student's unexpected effort or activity.&#x20;

Every point values below are doubled if I assess it to be done exceptionally. Thus, if someone produces a piece of writing that succeeds above my expectations, I will double the typical XP value as recognition of your accomplishment (e.g. a classnote done exceptionally earns you 2x 20).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Generally, each week you will come to class, read something, write something, and do an exercise (which may start in class and need to be completed outside of class). So each week you should typically gain 50 points (or roughly 600 over the course of the first term).&#x20;

| XP Gained      | Task                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20             | [For each piece of written work ](../coursework/reflections/)submitted                          |
| 20             | For each exercise (without written work) completed (e.g. tutorial level)                        |
| 1 / annotation | [For reading and annotating the assigned readings each week on time](../coursework/readings.md) |
