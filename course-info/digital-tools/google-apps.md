# Google Apps

For collaborative work, google apps (docs, sheets, calendar) are convenient, free, easy to use and powerful enough for most of our needs. We will use it as required, but for the most part I will ask you to use google docs and sheets, for example, to sign up for different things and to work together on assignment. You will need to have a google account and be willing to share it with the class.&#x20;

Here are support sites for the web apps we will be using:

* [google docs](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282664?sjid=4903168734100429097-NA) (collaborative word-processor)
* [google sheets](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282959?sjid=4903168734100429097-NA) (collaborative spreadsheets)
* [google drive](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282958?sjid=4903168734100429097-NA) (shared storage)
