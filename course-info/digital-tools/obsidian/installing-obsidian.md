# Installing Obsidian\*

To install Obsidian on your computer or device, navigate to [https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). The landing page will ask you to download files or will link you to an App store. Click on the button (in my case, since I'm using a Mac, it suggests I should download the version for macOS.&#x20;

Do what you need to do to install it. In macOS, I needed to double click on the downloaded file, and then drag the Obsidian app file into my applications folder. If you're using Windows or Linux, this will look a bit different, but should be relatively easy (and similar) to do.&#x20;
