# Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a powerful tool for taking notes and organizing knowledge. As they say:

> _Everything is connected_
>
> The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same. __ In Obsidian, making and following connections is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.

They are happy to describe what it is and what it is good for. We agree: it's benefits are:

1. it allows you to connect information easily and visual those connections
2. it can be used simply or in very complex ways - it has a community of developpers who keep expanding what it can do
3. it is future proof - it is easy to keep ownership of your information and you can easily export out information if you want to stop using it.&#x20;
