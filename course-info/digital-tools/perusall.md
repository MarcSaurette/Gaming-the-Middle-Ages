# Perusall

Perusall will act as a repository for the readings for our class.

To login to Perusal for our course,

1. Navigate to [https://app.perusall.com/](https://app.perusall.com/)â€‹
2. Register for an account or login to your existing account.
3. Click on the "Enroll in Course" button at the top of the page.&#x20;
4. Enter the code: **SAURETTE-YY72T** to join the class Perusall group.
5. If you are using Perusall for the first time, they will take you through a short tour to show its functionality. I encourage you to spend a few minutes doing this thoughtfully. If you every want a refresher, you can take the "tour" again, or read one of the many tutorials online, such as [this one](https://www.bates.edu/curricular-research-computing/lyceum-tutorials/perusall/adding-annotations/).&#x20;
6. Click on the "Get Started" tab to see some suggestions about how to read with Perusall.
7. Under the library tab you will find all the texts I have compiled for the course (most are not assigned and act as a repository for potential reference). Peruse them on your own time and according to your interests.&#x20;
8. Under the assignment tab you will see what readings have been assigned. They are organized chronologically.&#x20;
9. Click on an assignment, hit "open" and start annotating by highlighting text. You have the option to also annotate images (such as maps, for instance). In the annotation box, you can write texts, reply to fellow students, post images or links etc.&#x20;
