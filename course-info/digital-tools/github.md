### Github

You are currently reading this on Gitbook, derived from files hosted on Github. You can see the Github file for [this page here](github.md). That file is written in "Markdown", a simple text formatting language. For a guide to writing .md (markdown) files, take a look [here](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/). But your first steps should be:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account - either by going to the top right hand corner of this page and click on the Sign Up link (if you are reading this on Github) or by clicking [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-repo). If you have completed the [tutorial level](../../pregame/tutorial-level.md), you have already completed these steps and sent me your username.
2. My personal Github profile is [https://github.com/MarcSaurette](https://github.com/MarcSaurette). You should write down your profile url and your password somewhere. In the initial tutorial level you will record your profile address to send it to me. But you will use gitbook only infrequently so you might forget your passwords so make sure they are saved somewhere!
3. Our class repository is [https://github.com/MarcSaurette/Gaming-the-Middle-Ages](https://github.com/MarcSaurette/Gaming-the-Middle-Ages) which is used for storing class information and notes, but will use Teams for submitting your work in first term. In the Winter term, we will likely use Github more for file sharing/ collaborative work.&#x20;

**Next Steps (Optional):**

1. Complete the GitHub [starter guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) through the browser portal. Optional: look through as many guides as interest you, [here](https://guides.github.com/).
2. [Download](https://desktop.github.com/) the GitHub desktop which allows you to manage/work with your GitHub files offline. Install and set up the desktop version.
3. Press the "Fetch" Button, to download your online files to your hard drive. Locate where these files are on your hard drive for future reference.
