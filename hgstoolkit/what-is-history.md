# What is History?

### Goals for this week (September 13/15, 2022)

By the end of the second week, what should you **know**, be able to **do** and **understand**?

1. You will learn about History as an academic discipline and as a field of study, including some key terms and ideas foundational for understanding the learning we will do in this course.&#x20;
2. You will practice reading academic writing and will learn strategies for engaging productively with ideas in text – turning them into your own words/ thoughts. We will discuss the concept and practices of making annotations and "[smart notes](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes)".&#x20;
3. We will go over using Teams and Perusall -  digital tools key for this course.
4. Students must sign up to submit [classnotes](../course-info/syllabus/coursework/reflections/2.-obsidian-notes/classnotes.md) once a term by end of day, September 13th. [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sCloWfNgj3t\_YD8-vx2toFdw4BbTuWXFHJr2mHYP5zc/edit?usp=sharing).

### Overview:

The class introduces you to the discipline of History, major concerns and questions, as well as debates about the nature of history.

1. By Wednesday's class, students will need to have read, Danielle Kinsey's "Three Points About History, Especially for Non-Historians." _Canadian Journal of History_ 54, no. 1 (2019): 1-20. [https://www-utpjournals-press.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.3138/cjh.ach.54.1-2.01](https://www-utpjournals-press.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.3138/cjh.ach.54.1-2.01) and posted on [Perusall](../course-info/digital-tools/perusall.md).&#x20;
2. On Wednesday, we will explore together the question, "What is History?" I will introduce students to different debates on the topic. We will explore how historical learning and knowledge of history is important (or not important) in our society. We will spend some time talking about the Kinsey reading. Be prepared to come talk generally about how history seems relevent to your lives. We might consider such questions as:
   1. what is the difference between the past and history?
   2. what is the nature of History, as practiced in university vs. what we consider popular or public history?
   3. where does the idea and the academic discipline of history come from?
   4. what is the use of history? how can history be misused?
   5. where do you get your 'history' from?
   6. Do you think games can be "History"?
3. On Friday, we will introduce students to [Perusall](../course-info/digital-tools/perusall.md). In class, we will practice using it together to reread and annotate the Kinsey article together. Your annotations (and those of the class) will provide the raw material of a "literature note" to be submitted to Teams by 5pm, Tuesday September 19th.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

(on Perusall) Danielle Kinsey's "Three Points About History, Especially for Non-Historians." _Canadian Journal of History_ 54, no. 1 (2019): 1-20. [https://www-utpjournals-press.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.3138/cjh.ach.54.1-2.01](https://www-utpjournals-press.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.3138/cjh.ach.54.1-2.01)

_Optional reading_:&#x20;

Ahrens, Sönke. _How to Take Smart Notes : One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking - for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers_. 2017. (posted on Teams)

### Practice

By 5pm, **Tuesday, September 19th,** you need to upload a "literature-note" for Kinsey's article (incorporating your completed annotations) to your student~~-~~work folder on Teams. Each student is asked to create a folder for themself in the "Student Work" folder in the general channel _files_ where they will upload student work over the course of the term, by Tuesday, September&#x20;

Students will be expected to complete this exercise on their own time. [Instructions here](../course-info/assignments/2.-introduction-to-perusall.md).&#x20;
