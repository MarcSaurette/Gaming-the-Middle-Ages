### Practice

Create reference notes, as outlined in [exercise no ](../course-info/assignments/4.-writing-up-a-reference-note.md)5.&#x20;

Part of learning about games is playing them. I will host a game afternoon on Thursdays, so that we can get practice and experience with games.&#x20;

This is an experiment.&#x20;

Given our different schedules and demands on our time, it is not always easy to get together in the same room outside of class time. I am going to ask people to sign up for an account on [Boardgame Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/welcome), which is an online space for playing (digitized) boardgames.&#x20;

I've put together a class group, which I think will require that I invite people to it. I will need your account name to find and invite you. Add it to the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11qySQYeDCusmpIE28vK8rXUAB9KG5S8Ex-gD5SdNE6g/edit?usp=sharing).
