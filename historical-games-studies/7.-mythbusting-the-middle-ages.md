# 7. Mythbusting the Middle Ages

### Goals for this week (October 18th/ 20th)

On Wednesday, we will explore the topic of medieval religion.&#x20;

On Friday, we will discuss ideas of medieval identity. We will think about how gender and sexuality, as well as honour and reputation defined medieval ideas of individuality and community.&#x20;

We will also introduce the students to the Reacting to the Past game framework.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

Ames, Christine Caldwell. “Medieval Religious, Religions, Religion.” _History compass_ 10, no. 4 (2012): 334–352.

### Practice

(_Optional_): Create a literature note and a permanent note on the Christine Ames's reading. The topic of the permanent note should be, "What is medieval religion?" or some smaller subtopic on that theme.&#x20;
