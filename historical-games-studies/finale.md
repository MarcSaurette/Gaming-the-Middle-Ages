### Goals for December 6th

On this last day of class, we are going to meet to review the semester and discuss your work on the game journal project. We will talk about the [process letter](../course-info/syllabus/coursework/process-letters.md) which students will need to fill out to describe and self-assess their work in the Fall term. You will also need to justify your self-assessment in it.&#x20;
