# Finale

### Goals for December 9th

Carleton does something that might seem weird. In order to make sure that all classes have an equal number of meetings, they add an extra Monday class on the final Friday of term. This is because the class missed for Thanksgiving Monday is balanced out on December 9th.&#x20;

On this last day of class, we are going to meet to review the semester and discuss your work on the game journal project. We will talk about the [process letter](../course-info/syllabus/coursework/process-letters.md) which students will need to fill out to describe and self-assess their work in the Fall term. You will also need to justify your self-assessment.&#x20;

We might run this class from a pub if everyone is willing and of age.&#x20;
