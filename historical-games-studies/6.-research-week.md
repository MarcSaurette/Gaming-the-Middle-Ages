# 6. Research Week\*

### Goals for this week (October 11/ 13th)

On Wednesday, we will play a game developed by some of our librarians to help you discern and distinguish different kinds of sources. It is, in fact, called _Sources._ We will then speak about resources for undertaking research about the Middle Ages. And finally we will release you into the wild to complete a guided research quest, link to be posted on Teams at the end of class.&#x20;

On Friday, we will have our class in the Archives and Special Collections room on the fifth floor of MacOdrum Library. We will explore different medieval primary sources and early print materials.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

Nothing this week.&#x20;

### Practice

You will need to complete a Scavenger individually or in small groups to demonstrate awareness, at minimum, of different resources on campus. Instructions for the scavenger hunt will be released on Wednesday at 1230.&#x20;
