# Case Study: Chess II

### Goals for this week (October 31st /November 2nd)

This week we consider, using the case study of chess, the idea of games as material sources. They are objects that have a solidity, a provenience and a materiality. We will thus consider how games can be understood as material or visual evidence of the past.&#x20;

### Read/Watch/Listen

Note that antequated title of the objects as "chessmen" – even though they would be better described as a "Chess set" given the presence of the Queen piece...].

Many institutions have game collections, but in Rochester (NY) there is the Strong Museum of Play, entirely devoted to the idea and is home to a game research library, archives and the International Centre for the History of Electronic Games. Check out its online exhibitions!
