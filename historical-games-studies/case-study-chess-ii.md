# Case Study: Chess II

### Goals for this week (October 31st /November 2nd)

This week we consider, using the case study of chess, the idea of games as material sources. They are objects that have a solidity, a provenience and a materiality. We will thus consider how games can be understood as material or visual evidence of the past.&#x20;
