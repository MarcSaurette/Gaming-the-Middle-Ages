# What are Games?

### Goals for this week (September 26th/28th)

1. To understand how scholars define "Games" and why Historians are interested in them
2. To reflect upon the position of games in our society and try to extrapolate from that, why games were important in other societies
3. To consider key terminology about games and how to decribe them. We will try to create a "typology" of games

### Overview:

The class introduces you to the field of Games Studies/ Historical Games Studies. The professor will lead a discussion about the different ways to define what a "game" is and scholars have talked about them in the past.

* On Monday, the professor will lead a discussion about the two readings by C.T. Nguyen about games. Students need to have read the texts for Monday's class (September 26th). This class, students will be responsible for most of the discussion. We will not have a lecture by the professor, but instead, students will need to read the assigned works and be ready to discuss what they found most relevent and interesting.&#x20;
* On Wednesday, we will have a joint brainstorming session to try to establish a game typology: i.e. how to distinguish between different kinds of games, and if that helps us undestand how we interact with them.&#x20;

C.T. Nguyen also was interviewed on the Ezra Klein show **in February 2022,** where he states in a slightly different (and more approachable) way what is in his book**.** A link to the podcast and a transcript can be found here: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-c-thi-nguyen.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-c-thi-nguyen.html)
