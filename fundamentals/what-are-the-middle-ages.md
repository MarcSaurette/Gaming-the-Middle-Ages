# What are the Middle Ages?\*

### Goals for this week (September 19th/21st)

1. Double check that all students have signed up to submit [classnotes](../course-info/syllabus/coursework/reflections/2.-obsidian-notes/classnotes.md) twice a term. [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sCloWfNgj3t\_YD8-vx2toFdw4BbTuWXFHJr2mHYP5zc/edit?usp=sharing) if you have not already done so.
2. By the end of this week, students will get initial feedback about their first literature note on Kinsey's article.&#x20;
3. Discuss scholarly ideas of the Middle Ages as well as common myths about it (Monday); make students aware that many truths we take to be self-evident about the Middle Ages are actually ninteenth-century inventions.&#x20;

### Overview:

The class introduces you to the Middle Ages. The professor will discuss the different ways to define the period and how it has traditionally been defined.&#x20;



### Read/Watch/Listen

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to annotate this pdf with hypothes.is, you will need to open the pdf in the browser you are using with hypothes.is (I recommend Google Chrome). Usually your browser will not be the default software for pdf files, so you will need to right-click (or its equivalent) and select the command, "open with" and then select your browser.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Practice

This week you goal is to ensure that you have downloaded and installed the class Obsidian starter "vault" and integrated hypothe.is. By **Monday, September 19th,** you need to upload a literature-note for Kinsey's article (showing downloaded annotations) to your student-work folder on Teams (I will create a folder for each student in the "Student Work" in the general channel files.&#x20;
