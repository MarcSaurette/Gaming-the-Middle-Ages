4.

### Overview:

The class introduces you to the discipline of History, major concerns and questions, as well as debates about the nature of history. We will also practice&#x20;

1. By Monday's class, students will need to have read, Danielle Kinsey's "Three Points About History, Especially for Non-Historians." _Canadian Journal of History_ 54, no. 1 (2019): 1-20. [https://www-utpjournals-press.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.3138/cjh.ach.54.1-2.01](https://www-utpjournals-press.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.3138/cjh.ach.54.1-2.01)
2. On Monday, we will explore together the question, "What is History?" I will introduce students to different debates on the topic. We will explore how historical learning and knowledge of history is important (or not important) in our society. We will spend some time talking about the Kinsey reading. Be prepared to come talk generally about how history seems relevent to your lives. We might consider such questions as:
   1. what is the difference between the past and history?
   2. what is the nature of History, as practiced in university vs. what we consider popular or public history?
   3. where does the idea and the academic discipline of history come from?
   4. what is the use of history? how can history be misused?
   5. where do you get your 'history' from?
3. On Wednesday, we will introduce students to two tools: [Obsidian](../course-info/digital-tools/obsidian/) and [Hypothes.is](../course-info/digital-tools/hypothes.is/). In class, we get students to make use of these two tools, and get hypothes.is integrated with Obsidian. We will practice making notes and using basic tools in Obsidian. We will then reread and annotate the Kinsey article together, using hypothes.is.&#x20;
