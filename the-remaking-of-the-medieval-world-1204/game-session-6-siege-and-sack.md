In this class, we will simulate the siege and (potiential) sack of Constantinople.&#x20;

Once the March Pact is agreed upon and before the siege itself begins, Boniface can open the floor to speakers from each faction and the indeterminates to make speeches. These speakers should exhort their fellow crusaders with a **motivational speech or song,** or in the case of a cleric with a **sermon and blessing**. The most inspiring, as selected by the professor, will win their faction (or fellow indeterminates) a powerful boon.
