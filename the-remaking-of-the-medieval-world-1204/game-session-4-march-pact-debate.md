# Game Session 4: March Pact Debate

### Context

If the gathered crusaders agree to attack Constantinople, before the attack they must negotiate what their rule will be like in the event of their success. The March Pact was a sort of proto-constitution for crusader rule in Constantinople

### Moderator:

Marquis Boniface of Montferrat

For this debate, Boniface may appoint a proxy moderator.

### Questions:&#x20;

The first major debate of the game revolves around _**whether or not the army of the Fourth Crusade should attack Constantinople**_. Embedded in this debate are two ‘big picture’ issues:

* &#x20;the idea of just war, and&#x20;
* the question of what is a crusade, and if a crusader sworn to fight Muslims in the Holy Land can raise a sword against fellow Christians in Constantinople in the process.&#x20;
* Mixed in with these issues, characters will also discuss practicalities of supplies and logistics, and the geopolitics of the Mediterranean in the period.
