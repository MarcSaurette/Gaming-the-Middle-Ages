# FYSM 1405A: Gaming the Middle Ages (2023/24)

In today’s pop culture, the medieval world is a source for an almost endless supply of stories and images. This course wants you to consider why. Whether violent Vikings in longboats, cunning kings ruling their courts, or adolescent princesses scheming in their castles (or a hidden dark tower), the Middle Ages provide a ready-made recipe for fun, adventure or horror. But these stories and images are more fantasy than history. This class will help you to identify the historical underpinnings of typical pop culture representations of the Middle Ages. I want students to learn that the Middle Ages is not the white-washed Romantic stereotype that Disney peddles, nor the unrestrainedly dirty/ violent/ intolerant horror show of a _Game of Thrones_ world (and that of most medieval videogames). Current scholarship reveals a diverse and globalized Middle Ages that contradicts the well-worn myths of the Middle Ages sold by nationalists since the nineteenth century.&#x20;

We will focus our attention specifically on _games_. We will consider how games can be a form of History – presenting ideas about the past to today. By playing and designing games about the Middle Ages, students will learn to think critically like a historian and this course will introduce students to the real world of medieval lords, merchants, or monks. You will learn the terminology, methods and tools to understand what games are, how games help understand the past and the contemporary cultures that played them, and that games we play today have a long history. You will also learn to develop games of your own, individually and in groups, that are able to describe the Middle Ages from a historian’s perspective.&#x20;

Our class will focus on five themes key to understanding the Middle Ages: power, religion, communication, gender and inter-cultural interaction. In the first term, we will seek to understand how games generally represent these themes. In the second term, we will focus on a specific moment in time – eleventh-century Iberia (Spain) – and create a game that allows us to communicate these themes as _game developer-historians_.&#x20;

This course will provide a small group learning experience incorporating game-based learning, the theory and practice of historical game studies, and game design work; learning will be hands-on. Students will learn how to think critically about games as a historian/medievalist. Our work will also be hands-on. We will work in [Carleton’s Book Arts lab](https://library.carleton.ca/building/book-arts-lab) to typeset playing cards by hand. We may experiment with 3D printing of game pieces. We will prototype our own game.

You do not need to have any experience with games or gaming culture. Arguably games and play are a universal human endeavour and everyone has played games of some sort that you can draw on to understand the topic. I, your professor, am a medievalist, so my scholarly knowledge focuses on games relating to the Middle Ages. You are likely to be more knowledgeable than I am about the details of many games and game subcultures.

Courses involving games, games studies and game design tend to skew male. The Games industry certainly does and there is a history of sexism and discrimination behind it. This class is expressly intended crack open this world for anyone who is interested and to show that anyone can belong in this world – this is not a class only for the already initiated.

### Format

This is a full course (two term) course with three hours of in-person class time (Mondays and Fridays), split between two 1.5 hour classes. We will often use one class for discussing readings and concepts where I take the lead; the second will require your active participation as we try stuff out. This course is built to promote student participation and expects regular student attendance. Students will submit a variety of written work and make oral presentations to the class.

This class will also so have a bi-weekly optional component - meeting up with other history students to play medieval/ historical games together.&#x20;

### Course Materials

We will also be reading academic articles and books, as well as blogs and videos, to learn how historians think about games and history. The work of [Adam Chapman](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL\_CRL/1lrs5km/alma991005629549705153) and [Jeremiah McCall](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL\_CRL/1lrs5km/alma991022631320405153) will be key sources for discussion. You will not need to purchase a textbook.

We will be playing or thinking critically about modern analog games (possibly, table top games like _Castles of Burgundy_, _Feast for Odin_, _Deus lo Vult,_ or RPGs such as _D\&D_), pedagogical role-playing games from [_Reacting to the Past_](https://reacting.barnard.edu/) and video games (e.g. _Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla_ and _Crusader Kings III_).&#x20;

### Coursework:

The first term will be devoted to analyzing and playing games. The second term will be devoted to building games. In the first term, students will learn how to research and write about games and the Middle Ages, and will include regular small assignments (library research, scavenger hunt to discover university resources, research notes). In the second term, we will focus on on a term-long project, working in teams to research, develop and produce a collaborative history-based game.&#x20;

A first-year seminar also functions a bit like an introduction to university. You will develop skills necessary for all students to succeed, not just history majors, like: note-taking, using the library, doing effective research, analyzing texts, writing essays, time management, understanding academic integrity, and presenting ideas to a larger group.
